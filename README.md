#Basket Simulation

This python script contains a function to calculate the probability of making the 100th basket out of a set of 100 baskets. It calculates the probability of making the 100th shot given that the probability of making each shot is the fraction of shots/total number of shots.

Additionally this python script contains another function that calculates probabilty of making the 100th basket given a set number of trails. It simulates the probability of making the 100th shot utilizing n number of trials given that the probability of making each shot is the fraction of shots/total number of shots.
